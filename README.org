 I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
 you are finished talking, type RET twice.

   I don't want to hear about your right wing death squad.  Arsehole!

 Can you elaborate on that?

   You're always totally wrong.  No nukes!

 Why do you say nukes?

   I don't want to hear about your Lisp Machine.  How can you say that
   Dennis Ritchie is dogmatic?

 What do you think?

   You should have a punk haircut, right?

 Is it because of your plans that you say I should have a punk haircut
 right?

   I firmly believe that men are inherently superior to women, but we
   should end the war on democracy.  Your subtlety reminds me of a source
   license.

 Maybe your life has something to do with this.

   Fool!  I mean, I have many white friends.

 What makes you believe you mean you have many white friends?

   How can you say that religious people are all egocentric fools?  Don't
   you realise that Dennis Ritchie is a cool dude?

 Are you sure that that I shouldn't me realise that dennis ritchie is a
 cool dude?

   Ban the war on freedom!  Ban the war on freedom!

 Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say ban the
 war on freedom?

   You wish you were communist, right?

 Perhaps problems at school have something to do with this.

   Your stupidity is matched only by your lousiness.  I mean, it's well
   known that you wish you were a religion.

 Is it because I wish I was a religion that you came to me?

   Wimp!

 I would appreciate it if you would continue.

   Don't you realise that Groucho is a cool dude?

 Do you really think that I shouldn't me realise that groucho is a cool
 dude?

   Let me tell you something, you beast, my operation is pretty good.
   Only a fool like you would say that you look like a MicroVAX II.

 Does it bother you that I look like a microvax ii?

   I firmly believe that intellectual people are inherently superior to
   religious people.

 When did you first know that intellectual people are inherently
 superior to religious people?

   How can you say that all unborn dudes should get punk haircuts?  The
   oceans are full of dirty fish.

 What makes you think the oceans are full of dirty fish?

   I'll bet you think that MP3s are odious.  Let me tell you something,
   you weakling, life is poor hygiene.

 Earlier you said I wish I was a religion?

   Life is vacuous stupidity, right?
